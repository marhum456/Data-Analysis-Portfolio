# Climate Change Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets about climate change using machine learning techniques such as **SVM**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Logistic Regression**. The aim is to classify user sentiments into **Yes**, **No**, or **Neutral** regarding their belief in global warming.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [CrowdFlower Climate Change Sentiment Dataset](https://data.world/crowdflower/sentiment-of-climate-change)  
- Fields:  
  - **tweet** → text of the tweet  
  - **existence** → sentiment label (Yes, No, Neutral)  
  - **existence_confidence** → confidence score  

## 🔎 Features
- Data preprocessing & handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection & correlation analysis
- Training & evaluation of ML models
- Comparison of model performance with metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn** (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)  
- **Google Colab**
